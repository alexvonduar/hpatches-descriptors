## Extracting and saving descriptors from HPatches sequences: Published Baselines

In this repository, we attempt to collect code that shows how to
extract descriptors from sequences of the
[HPatches dataset](https://github.com/hpatches/hpatches-dataset), for
several published baseline descriptors.

Currently, the following descriptors are included. 
* [brief](brief/readme.md)
* [sift](sift/readme.md)
* [tfeat](tfeat/readme.md)

Please check the individual readme files for descriptor-specific information.

> If you have any reference implementation of a baseline descriptor
> extraction process for HPatches, plase open a pull request adding
> it.
