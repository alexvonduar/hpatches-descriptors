## Extracting and saving descriptors from patches - Matlab

Sample code that shows how to extract descriptors from the HPatch
dataset using Matlab.

### How to run
```sh
matlab -nodesktop
>> hpatch_extract
```

After the program ends, you will have folder named `misigma`
containing the descriptor values for the trivial (&#956;,&#963;)
descriptor.
