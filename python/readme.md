## Extracting and saving descriptors from HPatches dataset - Python

Sample code that shows how to extract descriptors from the HPatches
dataset using `python`.

### How to run
```sh
python hpatches_extract.py hpatches_db_root_folder
```

where `hpatches_db_root_folder` points to the folder of the downloaded
[HPatches dataset](https://github.com/hpatches/hpatches-dataset).

After the program ends, you will have folder named `misigma`
containing the descriptor values for the trivial (&#956;,&#963;)
descriptor.
